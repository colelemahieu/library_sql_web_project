A project using SQLite and Flask to creatively document and display my personal library on the web. So far this only includes fiction books. Nonfiction to be added soon.

Render was used to build and run this project (please be patient, the page may take a minute or two to load). View it here: https://library-sql-web-project.onrender.com
